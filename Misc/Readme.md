# Other Cheat Tables

## Pawperty Damage

Don't be dumb. Don't be a jerk. Stick to Sandbox and Photo mode with this, please.

Some cheats to make crushing stuff better. Primarily, a way to increase damage so buildings are destroyed with one step. Also includes a way to lock your character into the "Action" pose for custom models that look better with it.

Activate the *Scan for Player Settings* script to fill out the address list. Wait a second or two for the entries to refresh. Then, check the **Table Extras** in the lower-right corner of Cheat Engine for further instructions on how to set up the damage (if you don't know how to set a value, you double-click the number under the "Value" column). Finally, enter ``dontstopmenow`` in the Sandbox menu (not the pause screen) to remove collisions from buildings.
