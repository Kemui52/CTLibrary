# Final Fantasy VIII Playable Monsters & Devour Patcher

This table comes with a LUA trainer that makes playable monsters less glitchy, as well as assembly hacks that make the Devour skill always hit and work on any enemy. The table itself is filled with a lot of data and can be confusing, but it does have the addresses necessary to change out your party for a monster, redirect names, and customize battle encounters.

This is set up with a pointer for DuckStation 0.1-4918-g82965f74. You can swop it out for any other emulator pointer that leads to the start of PSX RAM. Examples from older emulators are at the bottom of the table.
