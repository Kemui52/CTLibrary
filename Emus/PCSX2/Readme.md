# PCSX2 Cheat Tables

A few cheat tables for games on PCSX2. I could've made most of these a regular code, but I can't find any code-type documentation for Codebreaker, so...

All tables are for the NTSC-U region of the game, unless it's Japan only. Most involve size modifiers and contain a bit of research related to that, but might contain some other fun stuff.

### Gauntlet - Dark Legacy

An AoB scan script for modifying the growth and shrink sizes, as well as item and stat research. The script requires **recompiler** mode, which you should have on by default anyway.

### Okami

A simple script to follow pointers and change the player's size. Not fully tested.

### Tetsujin 28-Gou

General research. Can replace character strings to play as other characters or see unused missions. Has a very prototype mission selector translation script.
